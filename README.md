This study investigates the impact of foreign remittances on school enrollment rates across 12 post-Soviet countries from 2002 to 2022. Using a fixed effects regression model and data from reliable international sources such as the World Bank and UNESCO, the research examines the relationship between remittances and enrollment rates at primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels. The findings reveal that remittances have a statistically significant positive impact on tertiary school enrollment rates, while no significant effect was observed for primary or secondary enrollment rates. This suggests that families in these transition economies are primarily using remittances to invest in higher education. The study contributes to the understanding of how international financial flows impact human capital formation in post-Soviet states, offering insights for policymakers in these countries.
